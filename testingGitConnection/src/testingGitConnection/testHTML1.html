	</p>
	
	<p class="p2"> Other tribes who entered the region during the colonial era were the Trockwae, Tutelo, Saponi, Shawnee, Nanticoke, Conoy Piscataway, Iroquois Confederacyâ€”possibly among others.</p>
	
	
	<p class="p3">  Other tribes, like the Erie, may have once held some land in Pennsylvania, but no longer did so by the year 1600.</p>
	

	<p class="p3"> Both the Dutch and the English claimed both sides of the Delaware River as part of their colonial lands in America. The Dutch were the first to take possession</p>
	
	<p class="p2">By June 3, 1631, the Dutch had begun settling the Delmarva Peninsula by establishing the Zwaanendael Colony on the site of present-day Lewes, Delaware.</p>
	 
	<p class ="p1">In 1638, Sweden established the New Sweden Colony, in the region of Fort Christina, on the site of present-day Wilmington, Delaware. New Sweden claimed and, for the most part,
	controlled the lower Delaware River region (parts of present-day Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) but settled few colonists there </p>
